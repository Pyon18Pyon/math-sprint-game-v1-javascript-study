This project was completed as part of the Udemy course, [JavaScript Web Project: 20 Projects to Build Your Portfolio](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-web-projects-to-build-your-portfolio-resume/).

## How to play?

This is a math based game. Select the number of questions, then click the **Start Round** button. After the countdown, simple math equations will appear on the screen. The current equation gets highlighted in blue so all we need to do is to evaluate whether the equation is correct or incorrect, and quickly click the **Wrong** or **Right** button. The timer starts when we click on the first button and it stops at the last equation. We will receive our score of how long it took at the end of each game. There will be 0.5 seconds penalty for every incorrect guess.
